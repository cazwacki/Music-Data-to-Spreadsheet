# Music Data to Spreadsheet

I wrote this in 2017 to take all the music I had on my computer and put it all on a spreadsheet so I could see what I had and didn't have. It goes through each music file and reads information from the meta-data and records the information to an Excel Spreadsheet. It has the following features:

- **Add File/Directory**

You can add individual songs, or the program can recursively add songs from a folder if you use the "Add Directory" feature.

- **Remove Selection/All**

Allows you to select songs you've added and remove them, or remove all the songs if you want to start from scratch

- **Export Songs**

Allows you to select a location to save the spreadsheet file. You can decide what information you would like on the spreadsheet (ex. Artist, Song Title, Bitrate, Album, etc.) and in what order you would like it to be.
